FEATURE: Filter by Operator & Platform
========================================

SUMMARY
-------
Add client-side filters to the departure/arrival board so users can
narrow services by train operator (e.g. only show South Western Railway)
or by platform (e.g. only Platform 1-4). These work alongside the
server-side calling point filter from Feature 02.

WHY
---
Large stations like London Waterloo show dozens of services from multiple
operators. Commuters usually only care about one operator. Platform
filtering is useful when you're already at the station and know which
platform group you need.

HOW IT WORKS
------------
- Filter bar below the navigation title (or as a horizontally scrollable
  chip row above the service list).
- Chips auto-populated from the current board data:
  - Operators: extract unique `service.operator` values from loaded board.
  - Platforms: extract unique `service.platform` values, sorted naturally.
- Tapping a chip toggles it on (highlighted in brand colour). Multiple
  selection allowed.
- When filters active, services not matching are hidden (client-side
  filtering of the already-loaded board.trainServices.service array).
- A "Clear filters" chip appears when any filter is active.
- Filters reset when switching Departures/Arrivals or navigating away.

This is purely client-side — no API changes needed. The full board is
already loaded; we just filter the display.

FILES TO MODIFY
---------------
1. DepartureBoardView.swift
   - Add @State private var selectedOperators: Set<String> = []
   - Add @State private var selectedPlatforms: Set<String> = []
   - Computed property `filteredServices` that applies both filters.
   - Replace `board?.trainServices?.service` with `filteredServices` in
     the ForEach.
   - Add filter chip bar as a Section at the top of the List, or as a
     .safeAreaInset(edge: .top) with horizontal ScrollView.
   - Reset filters in .onChange(of: selectedBoard).

UI DESIGN
---------
Filter chip bar (horizontal scroll, above service list):

  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ [SWR] [GWR] [SE] | [Plat 1] [Plat 2] [Clear]│
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Each chip:
  Text(label)
    .font(.caption.weight(.semibold))
    .padding(.horizontal, 10)
    .padding(.vertical, 5)
    .background(isSelected ? Theme.brand : Theme.brandSubtle,
                in: Capsule())
    .foregroundStyle(isSelected ? .white : .primary)

The chip bar only appears after the board has loaded and there are
multiple unique operators or platforms. If there's only one operator
and one platform, don't show the bar at all.

Separator between operator chips and platform chips: a thin vertical
divider or just extra spacing.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL
---------------------
Computed property:

  private var filteredServices: [Service] {
      guard let services = board?.trainServices?.service else { return [] }
      return services.filter { service in
          (selectedOperators.isEmpty ||
           selectedOperators.contains(service.operatorCode)) &&
          (selectedPlatforms.isEmpty ||
           selectedPlatforms.contains(service.platform ?? ""))
      }
  }

Use `operatorCode` (e.g. "SW") for matching but display `operator`
(e.g. "South Western Railway") in the chip — or use the short code as
the chip label to save space. Could show full name on long-press.

Available operators and platforms:

  private var availableOperators: [(code: String, name: String)] {
      guard let services = board?.trainServices?.service else { return [] }
      let unique = Dictionary(grouping: services, by: \.operatorCode)
      return unique.keys.sorted().map { code in
          (code, unique[code]!.first!.operator)
      }
  }

  private var availablePlatforms: [String] {
      guard let services = board?.trainServices?.service else { return [] }
      return Array(Set(services.compactMap(\.platform)))
          .sorted { Int($0) ?? 0 < Int($1) ?? 0 }
  }

EDGE CASES
----------
- Some services have no platform (nil) — show a "No Plat" chip? Or just
  exclude platformless services from platform filtering (they always show
  unless a platform filter is active).
- Operator codes like "SW" are short but some may be ambiguous. Use the
  full operator name as an accessibility label.
- If all services are filtered out, show "No services match filters"
  with a "Clear Filters" button.
- Natural sort for platforms: "1", "2", "10" not "1", "10", "2".
- Platform letters (e.g. "1A", "1B") should sort correctly.

INTERACTION WITH OTHER FEATURES
--------------------------------
- Feature 01 (time offset): filters apply to the offset-loaded board.
- Feature 02 (calling point filter): server-side filter reduces the
  board first, then client-side operator/platform filters narrow further.
- All three filters can be active simultaneously.

ESTIMATED SCOPE
---------------
~100 lines in DepartureBoardView.swift. No new files needed.
