FEATURE: Filter Board by Calling Point / Destination
=====================================================

SUMMARY
-------
Let users filter the departure board to only show trains that call at a
specific station. For example, at London Waterloo you could filter to
only see trains going via Clapham Junction, or only trains to Portsmouth.

The API already supports this via `filterCrs` and `filterType` params
which are wired into StationViewModel.fetchBoard() but never exposed.

HOW IT WORKS
------------
- New toolbar button (funnel icon) on the DepartureBoardView.
- Tapping it opens a sheet with a searchable station list (reusing the
  same station data from StationCache).
- Selecting a station sets it as the active filter.
- A filter type toggle: "Calling at" (filterType: "to") vs "Coming from"
  (filterType: "from"). Default is "Calling at".
- When a filter is active:
  - The toolbar funnel icon fills in (funnel.fill) and tints brand colour.
  - A dismissible chip appears below the navigation title or above the
    list showing "Calling at {station name} ✕".
  - The board reloads with filterCrs and filterType params.
- Tapping the ✕ on the chip clears the filter and reloads.
- The API response includes `filterLocationName` in the DepartureBoard
  model — display this in the chip for accuracy.

FILES TO MODIFY
---------------
1. DepartureBoardView.swift
   - Add @State private var filterStation: Station? = nil
   - Add @State private var filterType: String = "to"
   - Add @State private var showFilterSheet = false
   - Pass filterCrs and filterType to loadBoard().
   - Add toolbar button for filter.
   - Add filter chip as safeAreaInset or overlay.
   - Reset filter when switching Departures/Arrivals.

2. New view: FilterStationSheet.swift (optional — could be inline)
   - Searchable list of all stations from StationCache.
   - "Calling at" / "Coming from" segmented picker at top.
   - Tapping a station dismisses the sheet and sets the filter.
   - Recent filters section (store last 5 in @AppStorage).

UI DESIGN
---------
- Filter chip (when active):
    HStack {
      Image(systemName: "line.3.horizontal.decrease.circle.fill")
        .foregroundStyle(Theme.brand)
      Text("Calling at \(name)")
        .font(.subheadline)
      Button { clearFilter() } label: {
        Image(systemName: "xmark.circle.fill")
          .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
      }
    }
    .padding(8)
    .background(.ultraThinMaterial, in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 8))

  Placed as .safeAreaInset(edge: .top) so it sits below the nav bar
  but above the list content. Animates in/out.

- Filter sheet:
    NavigationStack with searchable list.
    Section "Recent" at top showing last 5 used filter stations.
    Section "All Stations" with full searchable list.
    Segmented picker for "Calling at" / "Coming from" at the top.

EDGE CASES
----------
- If filter returns no services, show "No trains calling at {station}"
  message with a "Clear Filter" button.
- filterCrs should not equal the current station CRS (nonsensical).
- Clearing the filter should animate the chip out and reload.
- The filter persists across pull-to-refresh but resets when navigating
  away from the board.

NICE TO HAVE
-------------
- Context menu on service rows could add "Filter to {destination}" as
  a shortcut — single tap to set the filter.
- Remember the last filter per station in UserDefaults so it persists
  between visits.

ESTIMATED SCOPE
---------------
~120 lines in DepartureBoardView.swift + optional ~80 line new sheet.
