FEATURE: Recently Viewed Stations & Journeys
==============================================

SUMMARY
-------
Track which stations the user visits and show them in a "Recent" section
on the home screen, between Favourites and Nearby. Also track recent
station pairs (e.g. "Waterloo → Portsmouth") so users can quickly re-check
a common journey's status.

WHY
---
Users often check the same 3-4 stations but don't want to favourite all
of them. "Recent" is zero-effort — just show what they looked at. The
journey pairs are even more useful: one tap to see "are there trains from
A to B right now?" which combines the station board with the calling
point filter from Feature 02.

HOW IT WORKS
------------
Recent Stations:
- Every time the user navigates to a DepartureBoardView, record the
  station CRS + timestamp in SharedDefaults.
- Show the last 5 unique stations (excluding favourites) in a "Recent"
  section on the home screen.
- Each row is identical to a normal station row with full context menu.
- "Clear Recents" button in the section header.
- Recents are stored in the shared suite so widgets could use them too.

Recent Journeys:
- When a user views a service detail, record the pair:
  (origin CRS, destination CRS, timestamp).
- Show last 3 unique journeys in a "Recent Journeys" subsection.
- Each row shows "Origin → Destination" with a tap action that navigates
  to the origin's departure board with a filter set to the destination
  CRS (leveraging Feature 02's filter).
- If Feature 02 is not yet implemented, tapping just goes to the origin
  board without a filter.

FILES TO CREATE
---------------
1. Departure Board/RecentStore.swift
   - Static methods: recordStation(crs:), recordJourney(from:to:),
     recentStations() -> [(crs: String, date: Date)],
     recentJourneys() -> [(from: String, to: String, date: Date)],
     clearStations(), clearJourneys().
   - Stored in SharedDefaults.shared under keys "recentStations" and
     "recentJourneys".
   - Max 10 stations, 5 journeys. Deduplicated, most recent first.

FILES TO MODIFY
---------------
2. ContentView.swift
   - Add "Recent" section between Favourites and Nearby.
   - Filter out stations that are already in Favourites.
   - "Clear" button in section header.
   - Optional "Recent Journeys" section with origin → destination rows.

3. DepartureBoardView.swift
   - Call RecentStore.recordStation(crs:) in .onAppear or .task.

4. ServiceDetailView.swift
   - Call RecentStore.recordJourney(from:to:) when detail loads, using
     origin and destination from the service.

5. SharedDefaults.swift
   - Add key constants for recentStations and recentJourneys.

UI DESIGN
---------
Recent Stations section:
  Same as the existing station rows (CRS pill + name), with the section
  header: Label("Recent", systemImage: "clock.arrow.circlepath") + Clear.

Recent Journeys section (if implemented):
  HStack {
    crsPill(from)
    Text(originName)
    Image(systemName: "arrow.right")
      .font(.caption)
      .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
    crsPill(to)
    Text(destName)
  }

EDGE CASES
----------
- Don't record the auto-navigated nearby station as "recent" (it wasn't
  a deliberate user choice). Check hasPushedNearbyStation or add a flag.
- If a station is later added to favourites, remove it from recents.
- Recent journeys with the same pair but different services should
  deduplicate (keep latest timestamp).
- When station cache refreshes and a CRS no longer exists (rare),
  silently skip it in the UI.

DATA FORMAT
-----------
recentStations: JSON array of { "crs": "WAT", "date": "2026-02-16T..." }
recentJourneys: JSON array of { "from": "WAT", "to": "PMH", "date": "..." }

ESTIMATED SCOPE
---------------
1 new file (~60 lines), ~50 lines across ContentView, DepartureBoardView,
ServiceDetailView. Small–medium scope.
