FEATURE: Quick Journey Planner (A → B)
========================================

SUMMARY
-------
Add a "Journey" tab or mode where users pick an origin and destination
station, and the app shows only trains that connect the two — with
expected arrival times at the destination extracted from calling points.

WHY
---
The current board-with-filter approach (Feature 02) shows trains calling
at a station, but doesn't tell you what time you'll *arrive* at your
destination. A journey planner pulls that info from the service detail's
calling points, giving a complete picture: depart at X, arrive at Y,
on platform Z, and whether it's delayed.

HOW IT WORKS
------------
1. User taps a "Journey" button/tab (either in the toolbar of
   ContentView or as a floating action button).
2. A sheet appears with two station pickers: "From" and "To".
   - Pre-fill "From" with nearest station or last used.
   - Searchable station lists for both.
   - Swap button (↕) to reverse the journey.
3. Tapping "Search" fetches the departure board for the origin station
   with filterCrs=destination (server-side filter).
4. For each service returned, fetch /api/service/{id} to get calling
   points and find the arrival time at the destination.
5. Display results as journey cards:

   ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ 14:30 → 15:47  (1h 17m)   Plat 3  │
   │ South Western Railway              │
   │ ● On time                          │
   └─────────────────────────────────────┘

   Showing: departure time, arrival time, duration, platform, operator,
   and delay status at destination.
6. Tapping a card navigates to the full ServiceDetailView.

OPTIMISATION
------------
Fetching service detail for every result is expensive (N+1 API calls).
Mitigations:
- Server-side filter with numRows=5 limits results.
- Fetch service details in parallel with TaskGroup.
- Show the board results immediately (without arrival times), then
  progressively fill in arrival times as each service detail loads.
- Cache service details briefly (5 min) to avoid re-fetching on
  pull-to-refresh.

FILES TO CREATE
---------------
1. Departure Board/View/JourneyPlannerView.swift
   - The main journey planner sheet/view.
   - Station pickers with search.
   - Results list with journey cards.

2. Departure Board/Model/JourneyResult.swift
   - Struct: service, departureTime, arrivalTime, duration,
     platform, operator, destinationStatus.

FILES TO MODIFY
---------------
3. ContentView.swift
   - Add toolbar button or floating button to open journey planner.
   - Or add as a second tab in a TabView (bigger change).

4. SharedDefaults.swift
   - Add keys for last journey origin/destination (convenience).

UI DESIGN
---------
Journey planner sheet:

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │         Plan a Journey              │
  │                                     │
  │  From: [London Waterloo      ▼]    │
  │                    ↕                │
  │  To:   [Portsmouth Harbour   ▼]    │
  │                                     │
  │         [  Search Trains  ]         │
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘

Results (below or replacing the picker):

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ 14:30 ─── 1h 17m ──→ 15:47        │
  │ South Western Railway    Platform 3 │
  │ 🟢 On time                         │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ 15:00 ─── 1h 22m ──→ 16:22        │
  │ South Western Railway    Platform 7 │
  │ 🟠 Expected 16:25 (+3 min)         │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ 15:30 ─── 1h 17m ──→ 16:47        │
  │ Great Western Railway    Platform 1 │
  │ 🔴 Cancelled                        │
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘

EDGE CASES
----------
- No direct trains: if filterCrs returns empty, show "No direct trains
  found. Try checking the departure board." (We're not implementing
  connections/changes — that's a full journey planner like Trainline.)
- Destination calling point not found in service detail: this shouldn't
  happen if the API filter is working, but handle gracefully.
- Split services: a train might split, with only one portion going to
  the destination. Check which calling point list contains the
  destination CRS.
- Same station for origin and destination: show an inline error.
- Remember the last 3 journey pairs for quick re-selection.

INTERACTION WITH OTHER FEATURES
--------------------------------
- Feature 02 (calling point filter) provides the same server-side
  filtering. The journey planner is essentially a richer UI on top of
  the same filterCrs mechanism.
- Feature 04 (recent journeys) should record journeys searched here.
- Feature 01 (time offset) could be added to the journey planner to
  search "trains after 16:00".

ESTIMATED SCOPE
---------------
2 new files (~200 lines total), ~15 lines in ContentView.
Medium complexity — the parallel service detail fetching needs care.
