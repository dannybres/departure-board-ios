FEATURE: Share Links & Siri Shortcuts
======================================

SUMMARY
-------
Add share functionality throughout the app so users can send deep links
to stations and services. Also donate App Intents / Siri Shortcuts so
users can ask "Hey Siri, show departures from Waterloo" or add a
Shortcuts automation.

PART 1: SHARE SHEETS
---------------------
Add share buttons / context menu items that generate and share deep link
URLs. These are the same departure:// URLs the app already handles.

Where to add sharing:
- DepartureBoardView toolbar: share the current station board link.
- ServiceDetailView toolbar: share the specific service link.
- Station context menus (ContentView): "Share Station" option.
- Widget: not applicable (widgets can't show share sheets).

What gets shared:
- A formatted message with the deep link, e.g.:
  "Departures from London Waterloo
   departure://departures/WAT"
- Or for a service:
  "14:30 to Portsmouth Harbour from Waterloo
   departure://service/WAT/{serviceID}"

Implementation:
- Use ShareLink (iOS 16+) or .share() modifier.
- ShareLink(item: url, subject: title, message: description)
- Add to toolbar as a share button (square.and.arrow.up icon).
- Add to context menus as "Share" option.

FILES TO MODIFY
---------------
1. DepartureBoardView.swift — Add ShareLink to toolbar.
2. ServiceDetailView.swift — Add ShareLink to toolbar/info sheet.
3. ContentView.swift — Add "Share" to station context menus.

PART 2: SIRI SHORTCUTS & APP INTENTS
--------------------------------------
Expose key actions as App Intents so they appear in Shortcuts app and
can be triggered by Siri.

Intents to create:
1. ShowDeparturesIntent
   - Parameter: station (StationEntity — reuse from widget)
   - Opens the app to that station's departure board.
   - Siri: "Show departures from Waterloo"

2. ShowArrivalsIntent
   - Same but for arrivals.
   - Siri: "Show arrivals at Waterloo"

3. GetNextTrainIntent (returns result without opening app)
   - Parameters: from station, to station (optional)
   - Fetches the board, optionally filtered by destination.
   - Returns a dialog: "The next train from Waterloo to Portsmouth
     departs at 14:30 from platform 3, expected on time."
   - This is a background intent — no app launch needed.

4. ShowStationInfoIntent
   - Opens station info sheet for a given station.

Spotlight indexing:
- Donate NSUserActivity for each station visited.
- Index favourite stations in CoreSpotlight with title, subtitle (CRS),
  and thumbnail.
- Tapping a Spotlight result deep links into the app.

FILES TO CREATE
---------------
1. Departure Board/Intents/ShowDeparturesIntent.swift
2. Departure Board/Intents/ShowArrivalsIntent.swift
3. Departure Board/Intents/GetNextTrainIntent.swift
4. Departure Board/Intents/ShowStationInfoIntent.swift
5. Departure Board/SpotlightIndexer.swift

FILES TO MODIFY
---------------
6. DepartureBoardView.swift — Donate NSUserActivity on appear.
7. ContentView.swift — Index favourites in Spotlight on change.
8. Departure_BoardApp.swift — Handle NSUserActivity continuation.
9. SharedDefaults.swift — Move StationEntity to shared file so both
   widget and app intents can use it (or keep separate copies).

SIRI PHRASES (auto-suggested)
------------------------------
- "Show departures from [station]"
- "Show arrivals at [station]"
- "Next train from [station]"
- "Next train from [station] to [station]"
- "Station info for [station]"

EDGE CASES
----------
- StationEntity is currently defined in the widget target. For app-side
  intents, either share the file or create a parallel definition.
  (AppIntents framework handles this with the same entity ID.)
- GetNextTrainIntent needs network access in the background — ensure
  the intent is marked as needing network.
- If no trains found, return a friendly "No departures found" dialog.
- Spotlight results should be kept up to date — re-index when favourites
  change and periodically clean stale entries.

ESTIMATED SCOPE
---------------
Part 1 (sharing): ~30 lines across 3 files. Trivial.
Part 2 (Siri/Shortcuts): 5 new files (~200 lines total), ~40 lines in
existing files. Medium complexity.
